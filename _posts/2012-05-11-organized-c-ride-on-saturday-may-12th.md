Sarah Matthews’ husband has set up a “C” ride tomorrow, Saturday May 12th, for anyone who is interested. The start / stop point will be in the parking lot of the Home Depot at Apple Valley Road and Bear Valley Road. The ride starts at 7:00 a.m.

A “C” ride means there will be a 10-15 mph pace, and no “drops” … the group will wait to make certain that everyone makes it back OK. There will also be plenty of rest stops.

[Here is a map of the route](https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/91477317 "C Ride").

To my knowledge, this is only the second organized “C” ride in the last several years. A “C” ride presents a great opportunity to get out, and to meet other cyclists who are either just getting started or just getting back into riding. With the near-perfect weather we’ve had this Spring, you owe it to yourself to air up your tires and get out on the road again.

If you’re too fast for a “C” ride, the VVBC also offers faster “B” and  
still faster “A” rides on Saturday and Sunday. [Here is the website of the Victor Valley Bicycle Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/84235983842/?ref=bookmarks "VVBC") (VVBC) with all the details.
