Last night I attended a board meeting for the 2015 Victor Valley Bicycle Tour (VVBT). Having been on the board of previous high desert bicycle events, I was extremely impressed by the organizers and their preparation even in these early stages, and excited by the progress they have made toward bringing this ride to life.

The 2015 VVBT will offer five route options. These are:

| Ride | Distance | Climbing | SAG stops | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 101 miles | 3,567 feet | 4 | $50 |
| 50 | 54 miles | 1,862 | 3 | $40 |
| 25 | 23 miles | 971 | 1 | $30 |
| 10 | 10 miles | Unk. | 0 | $20 |
| Kid's | n/a | flat | n/a | Free |

The proceeds of this event will be used to raise awareness of safe bicycling in our communities and promote cycling as a healthy lifestyle for both recreation and transportation.

There will also be start/finish line activities (including a carnival and BMX exhibition), with available hotel accommodations at the Courtyard by Marriott for anyone who need a place to stay. You can invite all of your out-of-town cycling buddies to join you for this one.

Registration is not yet set up, but you will be able to register on-line through Active.com, as well as in person at the site, starting the night before the ride.

I will be publishing updates here as I get them, or you can go to the ride's website: VictorValleyBicycleTour.com
