Last night I attended a board meeting for the 2015 Victor Valley Bicycle Tour (VVBT). Having been on the board of previous high desert bicycle events, I was extremely impressed by the organizers and their preparation even in these early stages, and excited by the progress they have made toward bringing this ride to life.

Before I go any further, save this date: Saturday, October 24, 2015.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![VVBT](https://www.hdcycling.org/_assets/img/2015/04/vvbt15.png)</figure>The 2015 VVBT will offer five route options. These are:

| Ride | Distance | Climbing | SAG stops | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 101 miles | 3,567 feet | 4 | $50 |
| 50 | 54 miles | 1,862 | 3 | $40 |
| 25 | 23 miles | 971 | 1 | $30 |
| 10 | 10 miles | Unk. | 0 | $20 |
| Kid’s | n/a | flat | n/a | Free |

The proceeds of this event will be used to raise awareness of safe bicycling in our communities and promote cycling as a healthy lifestyle for both recreation and transportation.

There will also be start/finish line activities (including a carnival and BMX exhibition), with available hotel accommodations at the Courtyard by Marriott for anyone who need a place to stay. You can invite all of your out-of-town cycling buddies to join you for this one.

Registration is not yet set up, but you will be able to register on-line through Active.com, as well as in person at the site, starting the night before the ride.

I will be publishing updates here as I get them, or you can go to the ride’s website: VictorValleyBicycleTour.com
