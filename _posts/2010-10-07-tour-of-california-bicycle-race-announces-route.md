2 Stages Will to be in L.A. Region

An 800-mile Tour de France-style road race tailored for California will be back next May and include two stages in the Los Angeles region, race officials announced today. The Tour of California is scheduled for May 15 through 22 and will hold stages between Claremont &amp; Mount Baldy and Santa Clarita &amp; Thousand Oaks, home to the sponsoring company Amgen.

Specific routing, however, has not been announced. For example, the route for the last stage could have cyclists leave Santa Clarita via the 126 Highway or via the Newhall Pass, sending racers through the San Fernando Valley. Those details are expected to come out in December or January.
