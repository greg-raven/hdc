**Big Bear Lake, Calif. March 12, 2015 –** This year, Big Bear Lake hosts the Amgen Tour of California Stage 6 Time Trial that takes place May 15, 2015. This marks the third time in five years Big Bear Lake is a host city for Amgen Tour of California, which is considered the largest and most prestigious road cycling race in the USA. Redlands Bicycle Classic, another premier-domestic race on the USA Cycling National Racing Calendar, has once again included Big Bear as one of its five stages for the third year in a row. Big Bear is set to host the Redlands Bicycle Classic Stage 2 Time Trial Thursday, April 9, 2015. These two elite professional road cycling events held in Big Bear, which are just one month apart, demonstrates Big Bear is well-received by the industry as a premier cycling destination.

“Having Amgen Tour of California and the Redlands Classic both stage races in Big Bear, in the same year, shows we're well-respected in the cycling community,” said Big Bear Cycling President Craig Smith. “These professional races help raise awareness and give Big Bear the recognition it deserves.”

The Stage 2 Time Trials in Big Bear, referred to as the Race of Truth, is an out and back course on the north shore. The 7.8 miles course starts and ends west of Stanfield Cutoff near the East Launch Ramp. The course leads racers into the town of Fawnskin, which is the turnaround point for racers to sprint back to the finish line. The course is challenging because of the demanding high-altitude environment.

One of the key reasons why Redlands Bicycle Classic as well as Amgen Tour of California stage races in Big Bear is to give the riders a change of scenery with a beautiful alpine lake and mountain vistas in the background. The community of Big Bear is thrilled to once again show the cycling world that the mountain resort is a premier cycling destination, and continues its quest as a cycling powerhouse for Southern California.
