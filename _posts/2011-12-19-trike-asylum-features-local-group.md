Trike Asylum has run a nice mention of the Sun City Trikers, a group of local recumbent trike riders who live and ride in Apple Valley.

> After the Coast to Cactus Tricycle Expedition, I ended up in Apple Valley, California, and more specifically in a subdivision of 1,200 homes called Sun City. I already knew that Will Baird and Gary Null, both residents here, had human powered recumbent tadpole tricycles, but was surprised to learn on this visit that there are more folks with these bizarre three-wheeled machines. For the population density in this close knit retirement community, the percentage of tadpole trikers is exceptionally high.
