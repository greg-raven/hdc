Members of the Victor Valley Bicycle Club will be holding a [criterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterium) practice on Wednesday, May 4th, at 6:00 pm.  
  
Spread the word so we can have a good turnout. We will start with 10 laps at an easy pace, followed by 40 minutes at race pace. This will be in the (now closed) [Lowe's parking lot on Dale Evans Parkway](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Lowe's+near+Dale+Evans+Parkway,+Apple+Valley,+CA&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=116.143266,108.105469&gl=us&ie=UTF8&hq=Lowe's&hnear=Dale+Evans+Pkwy,+Apple+Valley,+California&ll=34.527958,-117.213108&spn=0.004061,0.003299&t=h&z=18). Tommy will be there early setting up cones. If this is new for you, don't worry: It will be new for a lot of us.
