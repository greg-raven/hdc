The [Victor Valley Bicycle Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/84235983842/?ref=bookmarks) already offers A and B rides: A rides for the truly speedy, and the B rides for those less so. The B rides are billed as "no drop," which usually means that no matter how slow you are, someone will wait for you.

This doesn't seem to be the case, though, which has proven off-putting for some. This is not meant as a criticism of VVBC --- it's their ride, and they can conduct it any way they want. However, there seems to be some interest in a truly no-drop C ride.

Where the B rides average around 16 mph, I'm thinking the C ride would be closer to 12 mph average. Where the B rides seem to run between 30 and 40 miles, the C rides would probably be 20 miles or fewer. Given our current temperatures, rides may not start until Spring.

So the question is: Who's interested? Obviously, there will have to be enough participants to make it worthwhile, but we'll also need some leaders to help set the days and times, chose the routes, make certain everyone arrives home safely, etc.

If this sounds interesting, [let me know]({% link about.html %}).
