The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and CalTrans will be holding a meeting April 13 from 6 to 8 p.m. in the Council Chambers of the Town of Apple Valley to update everyone on the High Desert Corridor (HDC).

Depending on where Metro and CalTrans decide to put the HDC, there will be anywhere from minimal to maximum impact on cycling in Apple Valley. Therefore, we urge all cyclists in the high desert to attend these meetings.

**Location:**

Town of Apple Valley Council Chambers
14955 Dale Evans Parkway
Apple Valley, CA 92307

**Meeting Agenda:**

6:00 --- 6:30 p.m. --- Orientation/Open House
