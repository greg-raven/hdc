Looks as though all of us missed this one.

Pacific Sunset Velo held a time trial on Highway 173 today, one of a series of events they run out of their Ontario base.

According to the Pacific Sunset Velo website (https://psvelo.com), the schedule for 2013 is:

- Sunday, September 15
- Sunday, October 13
- Thanksgiving Day, November 28
- Sunday, December 8

I've e-mailed them in hopes of getting more notice next time. Whatever I get, I'll post here.
