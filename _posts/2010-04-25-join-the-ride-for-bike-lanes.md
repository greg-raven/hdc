The High Desert Cycling Association is putting on a ride to highlight the need for more bike lanes in the High Desert. The ride takes place Monday, May 3, 2010, at 6:00 P.M.

The route of the six-mile ride starts at the parking lot next to Lowe's and Baja Fresh in Victorville, and proceeds down Bear Valley Road, ending at the Automobile Club office in Jess Ranch Marketplace.

We're hoping to see mayors from each of the cities here in the high desert, and as many councilmen and other politicians as possible. If you're a politician, we want you to join us. If you know a politician, get him on a bike and get him there!

If you have any questions, contact Chuck at 760-961-2708.
