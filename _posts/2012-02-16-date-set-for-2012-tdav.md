The routes have changed from previous years. There are now going to be three rides, 10 miles, 25 miles, and 50 miles.

All rides start at 10:00 AM, with the 50-mile riders leaving first, then the 25-mile riders, then the 10-mile family riders. On-site registration starts at 8:30.

The 25-mile and 50-mile routes will be similar to the old 31-mile and 62-mile routes, but with some pieces missing.

The Tour de Apple Valley has set up a web page for the ride(s). You can register on-line via Active.com.

All rides start and end at Civic Center Park. Pre-registered riders receive a T-shirt and a goody bag. Riders participating in the 25-mile 50-mile rides will also receive a medal.

You can save by pre-registering by Friday, October 5th. Each participant will be required to sign a registration form and waiver prior to the start of the race. Each rider must wear an approved helmet, ride responsibly, and obey the rules of the road.
