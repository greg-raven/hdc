[Here are some photos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5nhhqtejx1ccoee/AAD6ci3l8yJ4h5H2mgiwH83ka?dl=0) from the 2012 Breast Cancer Awareness Ride (BCAR), which took place on Saturday, October 13th, at Victorville Cycles.

This was the fourth year for this event, and the turn-out seemed huge. Participants consumed virtually all parking at Wimbledon Village, and the riders had to be started in waves to reduce congestion.

There didn't seem to be many course markers, although there was a volunteer at one otherwise unmarked intersection to direct riders, which was very nice.

Thanks to the drivers in Victorville who waited patiently at intersections for the riders to go by.
