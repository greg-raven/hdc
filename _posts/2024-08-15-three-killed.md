Two men and a woman died following a collision between a motorcycle and a bicycle in Victorville early Thursday, authorities said.

The collision took place just after 12:20 a.m. within the intersection of La Paz and Valley Center drives, according to San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Mara Rodriguez.

It involved a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a mountain bike, officials said.

"The driver and passenger of the Harley Davidson, as well as the bicyclist, sustained life threatening injuries," the sheriff's department said in a written statement. "Despite life saving measures performed at the scene by medical personnel, all three succumbed to their injuries."

The motorcycle driver was described as a 30-year-old man, and his passenger was a 38-year-old woman, authorities said.

Officials described the bicyclist as a 57-year-old man.

No further details were available as deputies from a sheriff's Major Accident Investigation Team continued their work.

The intersection was shut down for several hours due to the investigation.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information, can reach the Victorville Police Department at  (760) 241-2911. Information may also be submitted anonymously to the We-Tip hotline at (800) 782-7463.
