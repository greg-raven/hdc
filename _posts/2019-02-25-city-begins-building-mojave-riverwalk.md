VICTORVILLE --- Crews have begun work on a concrete bike trail along the Mojave River near the lower campus of Victor Valley College.

City of Victorville spokeswoman Sue Jones told the Daily Press that work crews began grading and prepping the trailhead last week for the new four-mile Mojave Riverwalk that sits north of Bear Valley Road.

The trail will begin at Bear Valley Road near VVC and proceed north along the river's western flank to Yates Road just north of Spring Valley Lake. The trail will end at Park Road, which leads into the Mojave Narrows Regional Park, Jones said.

“This bike trail will branch into Mojave Narrows Park and lead bicyclists to Pelican Lake,” Jones said. “This entire four-mile trail will be classified as a Class 1 bike path.”

Part Two of the project will include the addition of bike lanes along Hesperia Road, Green Tree Boulevard and Seventh Street to create a large bike lane loop through Old Town connecting into the existing Riverwalk Trail near the city's Transportation Center on D Street.

The bike lane loop, comprised of Class II bike lanes, will be about 7 miles in length and will be designated with signage throughout Old Town.

Victorville Mayor Gloria Garcia told the Daily Press she's very excited that the city began work on the project that will bring a “great amenity” to the community.

“With 11 miles of bikeways, our Mojave Riverwalk will improve the quality of life in Victorville and help our residents enjoy an active lifestyle,” Garcia said.

The estimated cost for this entire project, including Part One and Two, is $5 million, with most of the cost funded through grants, including a federal Active Transportation Program Grant from Caltrans and a Transportation Development Act Grant from San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, Jones said.

The City of Victorville will supplement grant dollars with money from its Local Transportation and Measure I Funds. Sully Miller was awarded the construction contract for the project, she said.

Barring delays, the city expects the entire project to be completed as early as mid-July.

The new project will complement the City of Victorville's Mojave River Trail that runs along the Mojave River from D Street to Interstate 15.

In 2017, the Town of Apple Valley completed a portion of its new concrete Riverwalk, which extends along the eastern flank of the river from the Bear Valley Road bridge to the town's southern border at Poppy Road.

Future plans for the town include the Riverwalk extending along the river's eastern flank from the Bear Valley Road Bridge north to the Yucca Loma Bridge.
