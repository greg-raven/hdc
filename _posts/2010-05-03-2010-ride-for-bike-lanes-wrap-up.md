Thanks to everyone who participated in the Ride for Bike Lanes Monday afternoon (May 3rd, 2010). There was a great turn-out, and it's a fun ride when you get a critical mass of cyclists all together!

The route of the six-mile ride started at the parking lot next to [Lowe's and Baja Fresh in Victorville](https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=safari&q=Baja+Fresh,&ie=UTF8&sll=34.469981,-117.35085&sspn=0.033859,0.029655&split=1&rq=1&ev=zi&radius=0.84&hq=Baja+Fresh,&hnear&t=h&source=embed&ll=34.469981,-117.350807&spn=0.062694,0.062742&z=14), and proceeds down Bear Valley Road, ending at the [Automobile Club office in Jess Ranch](https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode&q=Automobile+Club,+Apple+Valley,+CA&sll=34.469981,-117.35085&sspn=0.033859,0.029655&ie=UTF8&hq=Automobile+Club,&hnear=Apple+Valley,+San+Bernardino,+California&t=h&ll=34.469274,-117.243476&spn=0.031347,0.031371&z=15&iwloc=A) Marketplace.
