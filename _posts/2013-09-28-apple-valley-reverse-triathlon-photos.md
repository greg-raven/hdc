Here are some of the photos I took of the participants at the 4th Annual Apple Valley Reverse Triathlon.

[Staging area]({% post_url 2013-09-28-apple-valley-reverse-triathlon-photos-staging %}) (47 photos)
: Everyone arrived and got set up before sunrise. What a scene!

[Start]({% post_url 2013-09-28-apple-valley-reverse-triathlon-photos-start %}) (50 photos)
: I turned my camera on at the last minute during the start of the run, but because it was an afterthought I didn't have it set properly, and I didn't even try to get everyone. As a result, the photos are pretty dodgy.

[Turn-around point]({% post_url 2013-09-28-apple-valley-reverse-triathlon-photos-turn %}) (2,168 photos)
: I'm pretty certain that I got a photo of everyone who made it to the turn-around point on Navajo, so if that describes you, your photo should be here. These photos should all be in chronological order. That is, the first person in the photos is the first guy to the turn-around, and the woman who appears in the last photos is the last rider on the course.
