Due to popular demand, the Tour de Apple Valley Family Ride is back! The 10-mile family ride allows you to bring the entire family for one, low price.  
  
Ride the 10-mile course by yourself for as little as $25, or bring the wife and kids for $50. Or to put it another way, when mom and dad ride, kids ride free! Bring as many family members as you want — you never pay more than $50.
