The Victor Valley Velo bicycle club will be hosting a year-long time trial series in order to promote a low-key, healthy competition for high desert cyclists.

The series will run from March through September with one time trial per month. Medals and ribbons will be awarded for individual time trials. There will be a trophy and prizes for overall winners.

There will be different classes of competition:

- Time trial bicycles --- male
- Time trial bicycles --- female
- Road bikes --- male
- Road bikes --- female

Road bikes will be allowed aero bars.

The fee to compete is $2.00 per rider.

Your bicycle should be in good operating condition; helmets are mandatory. You must sign a release form before competing. The roads used during the competition will also be open to traffic.

You may miss one competition and still be eligible for the overall prize, but you must make up the time trial within seven days on your own time.

Please arrive at least 15 minutes before the starting time. Riders will go off at 30-second intervals.

Timing will be [Strava](https://www.strava.com) based. If you are not on Strava please join, or arrange some way of timing yourself.
