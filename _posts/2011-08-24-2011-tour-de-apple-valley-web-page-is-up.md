The Town of Apple Valley has put up a page with all the details on the 2011 Tour de Apple Valley, which will be held Saturday, October 22nd this year.

We made some of the information on the TdAV page [available earlier]({% post_url 2011-06-15-date-set-for-2011-tour-de-apple-valley %}), but now there are links to the registration form, and the route maps for the metric century and the metric half-century (PDF files, all). There are no elevations on the route maps, but there are course directions. Note that the route for the metric century goes south on Central to Roundup, so you'll get a nice climb with a wonderful false peak before you earn your descent.
