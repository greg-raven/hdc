This isn't really specific to high-desert cycling, but for anyone who has been wondering if a recumbent might be a good alternative choice of cycles, Recumbent Cycle-Con is returning to the Fairplex in Pomona from Friday, November 1st, through Sunday, November 3rd.

Friday is a trade-only day. Saturday and Sunday public hours will attract a mixed consumer audience. Everyone will be able to test ride the bikes on two Outdoor Demo Ride Arenas; one for recumbent bikes, trikes and tandems; the other for adaptive cycling exhibitors and slower moving traffic.

This isn't just a gratuitous plug for recumbent cycles, though. It's also a gratuitous self-promotion, as I'll be there helping to man the booth for [Lightning Cycle Dynamics](https://www.lightningbikes.com/) on Friday and Saturday.
