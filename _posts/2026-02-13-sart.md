The third phase of the Santa Ana River Trail is now open.

It's now possible to walk or bike along the river from an area north of California Street in Redlands to Waterman Avenue in San Bernardino, and then through the city and the city of Colton, almost to the western end of Riverside, according to a news release.

A ribbon-cutting event was held Thursday, Feb. 12, for the 3.8-mile section, the newest phase of the trail.

Eleven miles of trail is now complete, and once the entire trail is built there will be a "complete path from the San Bernardino National Forest boundary in Mentone to the Pacific Ocean in Huntington Beach," the release says.

"Regional Parks is excited to complete this section of the Santa Ana River Trail bringing us 3.8 miles closer to the mountain crest," Beahta Davis, director of Regional Parks, said in the release.

The new portion increases recreational opportunities in a safe area away from the roadways, she said.

There will be 22 miles of trail in San Bernardino County once completed.

Phase four is broken into several sections for development and construction, Tammy Gann, a spokesperson for San Bernardino County Regional Parks, wrote in an email. The sections will be completed in stages.

The first section of phase four "is in design with construction scheduled to begin after bird nesting season," she wrote, and "will extend the trail from California Street in Redlands to Opal Avenue in Mentone."

Phase four's first section is "grant funded by the State Coastal Conservancy with a projected cost of $6.8 million," Gann said, and they're seeking funding for the other sections.
