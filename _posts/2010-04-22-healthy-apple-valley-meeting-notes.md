Tues., May 25 --- *SAVE THE DATE!*

We will notify you by 5/10 if we will be participating in a town council presentation relating to Healthy Apple Valley. If we are, we will also be holding our monthly meeting at 5 p.m. (before the council meeting at 6:30 p.m.) There will be NO meeting on 5/27.

### Grant Funding Opportunities

Linda Mayfield is working on a California Wellness grant and will look into possibility of a Kaiser HEAL grant. We are also awaiting to hear if funding will be granted, to the Town, by the Dept. of Public Health (awards will be announced 5/8)

### Subcommittee Formation

Three subcommittees were formed with members present at the meeting.

\*\* Members not present at the 4/22 meeting can STILL SIGN UP FOR A SUBCOMMITTEE (Please notify Valerie at [valerie\_smith@avusd.org](mailto:valerie_smith@avusd.org) of your interest, asap)

Subcommittees WILL be meeting prior to our May 25 meeting. The designated chairs of each subcommittee will be in contact with members on their respective subcommittee to establish a meeting.

Subcommittee responsibilities were discussed. Responsibilities of the subcommittees, prior to the 5/25 meeting, will be to research what other communities are doing, determine what you think your subcommittee could do, set some goals, and be ready to provide some suggestions to the larger group.
