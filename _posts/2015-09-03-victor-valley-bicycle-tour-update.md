Got a call today from a rider who lives outside our area, who had heard about the Victor Valley Bicycle Tour we have coming up on October 24. He had a couple questions, so I contacted one of the ride organizers to get the answers. Just in case these same questions have crossed your mind, here's what I found.

1. There is a website for the ride: VictorValleyBicycleTour.com

2. The routes will be marked with signs at each turn. (The routes are already available on-line via MapMyRide.)

3. Each rider gets a number plate and a wristband. The wristband is color-coded based on which of the rides you are doing.

4. This is a ride, not a race, so there will be no timing nor record kept of the finishing order.
