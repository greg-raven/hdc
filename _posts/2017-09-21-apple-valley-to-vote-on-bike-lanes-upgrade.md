The Apple Valley Town Council will be voting at the September 22 council meeting to award a contract to All American Asphalt for the Townwide Class II Bikeway Upgrade --- Project No. 2016-03.

The project includes the installation of marking, striping, and new signs to meet bike lane standards in accordance with the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) on Class II bike lanes along several miles of paved main arterials within the Town of Apple Valley. Additionally, four signalized intersections along Apple Valley Road will be widened to accommodate the upgraded bike lanes.

The proposal includes a map of the locations to be upgraded.
