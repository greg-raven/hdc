The 3,000-mile [Ride 2 Freedom](http://ride2freedom.us) from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. passed through the Victor Valley on Sunday morning.

The Ride, which started in Santa Monica on June 1st (International Children’s Day), consists of 30 young adults, most of whom have no bicycling experience, riding across the United States to call attention to the plight of orphaned children of Falun Gong members persecuted in China for their spiritual beliefs.

The group of cyclists and support vehicles was last seen traveling east on Hwy. 18 at Dale Evans Parkway shortly after 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, June 14th.
