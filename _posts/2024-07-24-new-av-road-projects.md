The Town of Apple Valley's recent budget adoption includes a summary of proposed and ongoing improvement projects, with details on how they will be funded, how they are progressing and what the estimated costs are.

Through the annual Capital Improvement Program, the town department manages the planning, design, and construction of projects, including streets, sidewalks, traffic signals, storm drains, stormwater infiltration systems, and traffic management-related signage and markings. 

One of the Town of Apple Valley's capital improvement projects is the Dale Evans Parkway at Waalew Road Realignment project. Once completed, commuters driving north or south on Dale Evans Parkway will avoid making a left or right on Waalew Road to reconnect with Dale Evans Parkway.
Additionally, the department plays a key role in processing, reviewing, approving, permitting, and inspecting development-related infrastructure construction and on-site grading within town limits.

**Dale Evans Parkway at Waalew realignment**

Highlights of capital improvement projects include the Dale Evans Parkway at Waalew Realignment project at the cost of nearly $2.7 million.

The project will allow commuters driving north or south on Dale Evans Parkway to avoid making a left or right on Waalew Road to reconnect with Dale Evans Parkway. 

During the previous fiscal year, the town completed the initial design, began coordinating with Southern California Edison for power line relocation, and worked with the property owner to obtain the right of way.

**Yucca Loma Road widening**

The project includes the not-yet-begun widening of Yucca Loma Road from Apple Valley Road to Rincon Road. The project includes the addition of bicycle lanes, sidewalks and an equestrian trail. 

The nearly $7.4 million project will be constructed in two phases.

The first is from Apple Valley Road to 1,200 feet east, allowing better traffic flow. The second phase will be constructing the remaining portion of Yucca Loma Road to Rincon Road

Previous fiscal year actions include the beginning of phase one, and acquiring temporary construction easements from property owners for phase two.

**State Route 18 corridor study**

The Highway 18 corridor study would include the inspection and review of the roadway between Apple Valley Road and Bass Hill Road.

The town received a Sustainable Communities Planning Grant from the California Department of Transportation to prepare a comprehensive study of a portion of Highway 18.

The planning process will address access barriers by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the corridor and recommending potential countermeasures. 

The final Apple Valley State Route 18 Corridor Enhancement Plan Phase II will serve as a blueprint for guiding future improvements on Highway 18, along the studied corridor. 

Previous fiscal year actions have included collecting community feedback through online surveys and at multiple town-sponsored events. Additionally, identifying potential projects and preparation for the final plan.

One of the Town of Apple Valley's capital improvement projects includes improvements to the intersection of Bear Valley Road and Kiowa Road.

**Powhatan Road Complete Streets**

This proposed project includes the revitalization of Powhatan Road from Navajo Road to Central Road in the Apple Valley Village for an estimated cost of $1.8 million.

While sidewalks exist in some areas of Powhatan Road, they are separated by large gaps. The project will fill the gaps, add new ADA-compliant curb ramps, install crosswalks, and provide a Class III Bikeway. Once complete, the project will provide unobstructed mobility to jobs, parks, and services for pedestrians and bicyclists, staff stated.

**Rancherias Plaza frontage road conversion**

The project will eliminate Outer Highway 18 North from Rancherias Road to Bass Hill Road. The first stage of the project will be a feasibility study to determine the best alternatives followed by full design. 

**Reata Road intersection improvements** 

The project at the intersection of Bear Valley Road and Reata, one of the busiest in town, includes improvements based on the results of the Bear Valley Commercial Corridor Signal Study.

**Central Road widening**

The project includes the design and reconstruction of Central Road from Bear Valley Road to Hwy. 18, with the addition of a continuous left turn lane, bike lanes, and bus turnouts. 

Previous fiscal year actions have included finalizing an initial topographic and boundary survey, and alternative design options. Also, coordinating with utility companies.

One of the Town of Apple Valley capital improvement project includes the not-yet-begun widening of Yucca Loma Road from Apple Valley Road to Rincon Road. The project includes the addition of bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and an equestrian trail.
Bear Valley Bridge rehabilitation

The project includes rehabilitation of the Bear Valley Road Mojave River bridge west of Apple Valley Road. 

The Engineering Department retained a consultant for structural engineering services to analyze and rehabilitate the existing bridge. 

The consultant will also prepare an engineering design to widen the bridge to address the deficient deck geometry. 

The ultimate bridge section will include six east-west travel lanes, a center median, shoulders, sidewalks, and a class 1 bikeway. 

The Engineering Department successfully secured federal funds under the Highway Bridge Program.

Tasks still to be completed for this multi-year project include utility relocation, right-of-way certification, bridge rehabilitation, and widening design plans and construction. 

Previous fiscal year actions include the completion of preliminary design, obtaining environmental permits and clearance, and right-of-way certification.

The cost of the project is nearly $58 million.

**Bear Valley Road and Kiowa Road** 

The improvement project at the intersection of Bear Valley Road and Kiowa Road includes improvements to traffic signals and ADA access and a new Victor Valley Transit Authority bus turnout constructed on Bear Valley Road east of Navajo. 

Previous fiscal year actions include the completed design and bid package, and coordinating with utility agencies.

The project cost is nearly $1.5 million.

**Yucca Loma Elementary School Safe Routes to School**

The project area is Powhatan Road from west of Mohawk Road to Navajo Road and Rancherias Road from Powhatan Road to the school boundary 

The project will add accessible pathways from the residential neighborhood adjacent to Yucca Loma Elementary School where students and their families live. 

Sidewalks will be constructed along Powhatan Road to Navajo Road and on Rancherias Road from Powhatan Road to the school's southerly driveway approach. The grant-funded project was identified as a priority in the Safe Routes to School Master Plan

**Safe Routes to School Implementation**

The town will continue to identify new opportunities to implement recommendations outlined in the ongoing Safe Routes to School Master Plan. 

The goal of this project is to reduce traffic dangers that prevent children from walking or biking to school safely, and expand the safe environment at our schools out onto the surrounding roads, Apple Valley Unified School District officials told the Daily Press in a previous interview.

Improvements have been previously made at Mariana Academy, Sandia Academy, Rio Vista Elementary, Rancho Verde Elementary, Sycamore Rocks Elementary, and Yucca Loma Elementary.
