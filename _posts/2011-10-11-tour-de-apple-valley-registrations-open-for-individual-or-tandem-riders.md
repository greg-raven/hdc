Ride into fall by participating in the Fourth Annual Chuck Hanson Tour de Apple Valley October 22. Check in at Apple Valley Civic Center Park at 6 a.m. for the 7 a.m. ride.

The tour will offer two distances: 31 miles and 62 miles. Proceeds will benefit the Police Activities League. Registration is $60 for individual riders and $70 for tandem riders.

This is the third year this tour has been named after Chuck Hanson, an avid Town supporter and community activist who has supported the building of additional bike lanes for years. Hansen has cycled more than 450,000 miles, including a 508 mile ride that he entered when he was 70 years old. Hansen has biked across the country four times, including a trek that started in Cerritos, California and ended in Washington D. C.

Hanson and his wife, Pat, continue to support the event by seeking out donations and sponsorships from local businesses. To participate or get more information, call the Apple Valley Parks and Recreation office at (760) 240-7880.
