The Redlands Bicycle Classic is back this week after a two-year coronavirus hiatus with a "new" course, road closures, and plenty of opportunities for public participation.

The race starts Wednesday, April 20, in Highland.

That "stage is a 'circuit' race, which means the cyclists will be completing numerous laps around the course," officials said in a mailer to community members. "This will give you an opportunity to see them up close and cheer them on as they pass by your location."

Roads to be closed in Highland include eastbound Base Line, Jack Rabbit Lane, Foxtail Way, Glenheather Drive, Tonner Drive, Orange Street, Sycamore Drive, Webster Street and Church Street. Most of the roads are slated to be closed from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

On Thursday, racers will be in Yucaipa and Oak Glen. Some, but not all of the road closures there begin at 8 a.m. and last until 3 p.m. Affected roads in the area include Sunnyside Drive, Crafton Avenue and Oak Glen Road.

"This is a great spectator course, and ends in beautiful Oak Glen, where you can enjoy a slice of fresh apple pie," officials tweeted on April 14.

Friday is the 9.1-mile Route 66 Time Trial course in the Cajon Pass that was last used in 1996.

Cajon Boulevard will be closed from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. between Cleghorn Road in the pass to Kenwood Avenue in San Bernardino.

Saturday and Sunday events will be in Redlands.

Part of Citrus Avenue in Redlands will be closed beginning at 4 p.m. Friday.

Saturday, all-day closures in downtown Redlands include parts of Citrus and Olive avenues as well as on Sixth, Vine, Cajon, Orange and Fourth streets.

There will be similar closures in downtown Redlands on Sunday as well as closures on portions of San Mateo Street, Highland Avenue, Cajon Street, Garden Street and Sunset Drive.

Motorists traveling to and from businesses or residences on the course must talk to a race marshal before entering the road, and must wait until no cyclists are approaching.

Officials also ask that residents secure their pets during the race as loose dogs present a hazard to competitors.

Registration begins at 7 a.m. Saturday for youth races on the lower level of the parking structure on the corner of Fifth Street and Citrus Avenue in Redlands. Other events downtown that day include two BMX shows.

There will also be rides for adults on Saturday and Sunday.

The classic started in 1985. This will be the 36th year it has been held.
