The High Desert Cyclists invite you to join the Bike Ride for Bike lanes, Monday, May 2, 2011.  
  
Meet in the parking lot by Lowes and Baja Fresh in Victorville at 6:00 PM. The ride starts at 6:15 PM, ending approximately six miles down Bear Valley Road at the AAA Automobile Club office in the Jess Ranch Marketplace. If you choose to ride, you must wear a helmet.

The High Desert Cycling Association urges everyone to participate and help encourage local officials to provide bikes lanes on all our high desert streets. If you have any questions or wish to help sponsor or promote the event, call Pat Hanson at 760-961-2708.
