The High Desert Cyclists invite you to join the Bike Ride for Bike lanes, Monday, May 2, 2011.

Meet in the parking lot by Lowes and Baja Fresh in Victorville at 6:00 PM. The ride starts at 6:15 PM, ending approximately six miles down Bear Valley Road at the AAA Automobile Club office in the Jess Ranch Marketplace. If you choose to ride, you must wear a helmet.
