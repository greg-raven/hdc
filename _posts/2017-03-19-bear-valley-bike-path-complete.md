APPLE VALLEY --- Two separated sections of a bike path on the northern side of Bear Valley Road were recently completed, forging a cyclable connection between Jess Ranch Marketplace and Victor Valley College.

The first section of the Bear Valley Bike Path starts at Reata Road and --- heading west --- extends more than 1,000 feet to Jess Ranch Parkway, town documents show. The second section starts at the west end of the Bear Valley Road Bridge and continues to Mojave Fish Hatchery Road, a distance slightly shorter than the first.

The Town Council approved acceptance of Riverside Construction's work on the the Class I pathway during its Feb. 28 meeting. The total cost reached nearly $394,000, according to town documents.

The two sections comprise the first of a two-phase project. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the original bids were higher than town officials expected, so the project was split between the two municipalities.

"The Jacaranda (Avenue) to (VVC's) upper campus segment is phase 2," Martin said, "and the City of Victorville is putting together the funding for that portion."

Officials in Victorville were not available for comment as City Hall is closed Fridays.

A majority of funding for the town's portion of the project project came from a $386,370 Transportation Development Act grant approved by the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority --- formerly San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG). The town is responsible for a 20-percent match using Measure I funds, according to a previous Daily Press report.

The town awarded a contract to Riverside Construction in September 2016, with work starting in November. Martin spoke to the importance of the Bear Valley Bike path last week.

"(It's) definitely a connector between Jess Ranch Marketplace and VVC," she said, "as well as an important link to the loop that includes the Mojave Riverwalk and Yucca Loma Bridge."
