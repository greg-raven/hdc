This is a reminder that today is the last day to use the 15% discount code EARLY-BIRD25 for the 2025 Victor Valley Bicycle Tour (VVBT). Prices will increase as the event date approaches.

This annual event aims to promote bicycle safety within the High Desert community. All proceeds from the event will be donated to local schools that support this mission.

Additionally, funds will be allocated to the cities in the High Desert for installing bicycle safety signs, purchasing equipment, and supporting other related initiatives.
 
We invite you to join us in promoting bicycle safety by registering for the event. We look forward to seeing you all there!
