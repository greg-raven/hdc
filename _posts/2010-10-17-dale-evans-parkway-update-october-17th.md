Dale Evans Parkway has now been completely repaved between Otoe and Waalew, although it has yet to be striped. It seems much wider now, so there should be plenty of room for the bike lanes.  
  
One odd feature is that on the southbound side, just north of Otoe, a bike path that splits off from Dale Evans Parkway and runs parallel, down to the intersection at Otoe, around a large Joshua Tree.

There's been some talk about having a ribbon-cutting ceremony once work on this stretch of Dale Evans Parkway is finished. It would be great to have a strong showing of the cycling community at this event.

We'll keep you posted.
