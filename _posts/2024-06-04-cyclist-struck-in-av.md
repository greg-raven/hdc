APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (VVNG.com) --- A bicyclist was critically injured after he was hit by a vehicle Monday night in Apple Valley.

It happened on June 3, 2024, at approximately 9:10 PM, on Thunderbird Road and Wichita Road, in the Town of Apple Valley. 
 
"Through investigation, deputies determined a black Ford Explorer, driven by a 36-year-old, was eastbound on Thunderbird Road in the number one lane approaching Wichita Road. The bicyclist was riding eastbound in the number 1 lane of Thunderbird Road. The Ford Explorer struck the bicyclist on Thunderbird Road," stated sheriff's officials in a written statement.
 
The bicyclist, a 52-year-old male from Apple Valley, suffered major injuries and was transported to a local hospital by ambulance. The bicyclist later was airlifted to another hospital. The driver of the Ford Explorer was uninjured and remained on scene to cooperate with the investigation.
