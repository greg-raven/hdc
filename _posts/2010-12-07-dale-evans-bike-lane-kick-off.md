Bring your bike as we ride the Dale Evans Parkway bike lane. Meet at the [Lenny Brewster Sports Center, 21024 Otoe Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21024+Otoe+Rd,+Apple+Valley,+CA+92307/@34.5444132,-117.2070043,1205m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80c3623917d5cb19:0x15a180f0ab960754!8m2!3d34.5444132!4d-117.2044294!16s%2Fg%2F11ggs9zj0y?entry=ttu) on March 24th at 6:30 pm. The ride starts at 6:45 pm. The ride will be to Waalew Road and back. Helmets are a must.

Note that this ride doesn't even begin until *after* civil twilight. The ride won't be that long, so you shouldn't need lights, but if you want to combine this kick-off ride into a longer ride, you'll need to take this into account.
