Caltrans District 8 is seeking public input on its draft Active Transportation Plan as the agency works to improve bicycle and pedestrian components on highways across the High Desert and the Inland Empire.

The Active Transportation Plan identifies locations for future bicycle and pedestrian improvements by the agency, which plans to align the state's bicycle/pedestrian network with the needs of local communities.

An emphasis would be placed on improving social equity, reconnecting communities and improving access for all modes of transportation, including people who walk and bicycle.

"It's our priority to ensure safe access for all users across our transportation system. This Active Transportation Plan aims to improve safety and access for people who walk, bicycle, and use transit," said Caltrans District 8 Director Michael Beauchamp. "Improving our active transportation network will result in improved air quality, health, social equity, quality of life, and economic opportunity."

In the High Desert, the Active Transportation Plan shows the need for great improvement along Palmdale Road/Highway 18 in Victorville, Highway 18 in Apple Valley, Interstate 15, Highway 395, and Highway 247.

The public draft is the culmination of the data analysis of existing conditions, along with localized map-based survey responses from the public in Fall 2021.

The data informs Caltrans of locations where Complete Streets improvements are needed for bicyclists, pedestrians, and public transit users, allowing Caltrans to evaluate these locations when developing future projects.

Community members are encouraged to review the Plan and provide comments before it is finalized in July.
