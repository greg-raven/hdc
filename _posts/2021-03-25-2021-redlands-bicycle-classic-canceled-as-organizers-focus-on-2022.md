The 2021 Redlands Bicycle Classic has been canceled, organizers announced this week, despite hopes earlier in the year for a possible fall event.

"We have decided to cancel the race for 2021, focusing on creating an amazing race in April 2022, with all the elements people have come to love," officials tweeted on Monday, March 22.

In February organizers called off the proposed April start due to coronavirus precautions and said they might hold an event in the fall, but the focus is now shifting to a 2022 race instead.

COVID-19 precautions also led to the cancellation of the 2020 race.

Executive Director Marc Shaw thanked sponsors in a news release and noted that host cities "have all faced significant financial constraints as a result of the pandemic and without the support of their public safety, public works, and community services departments, we would face great challenges in creating a safe race environment."

In 2019, the last year the race was held, there were stages in Redlands, Yucaipa, Oak Glen, and Highland. That year, there were about 300 professional competitors, 200 amateur competitors, and 500 youth in the Kid Races. Pro racers also talked to more than 10,000 students at school assemblies that year. The event also requires 400 volunteers and about 13,000 spectators crowd downtown Redlands for the final races.

The five-day event is slated to roll back into town on April 20, 2022.
