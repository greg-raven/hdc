The Tour de Irwin is coming up (Saturday, May 18th). This is an actual race (as opposed to a ride).

Fort Irwin, 37 miles North East of Barstow, is holding its 7th annual Tour de Irwin, a 41-mile race to the Mars satellite dish on NASA property. This is a once-a-year opportunity to gain access to the Fort Irwin National Training Center for a bike ride to the 210-foot diameter satellite dish on what looks to be an incredible morning for riding. More information is available at 760-380-4327. Ride to earn the prestigious Tour de Irwin coin, the Champion Cup, and the Winners Jersey! Pancake breakfast being served, but a riders meal is included in the $35 entry fee. Good luck everyone!

All races begin and end at Outdoor Recreation, Building 4100 on Goldstone Road. The main race (41 miles) goes all the way to the NASA Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex with a detour to the Apollo Complex. There will be water stations, medical personnel, and a bike mechanic available along the route.

If you are not interested in racing, though riders are welcome to practice the route on Saturdays and Sundays during daylight hours. Have your ID on hand to present at the Goldstone security gate. (You will not have to stop during the day of the actual race.)

This seems an excellent opportunity to see this normally-restricted area, without having to commit to a race.
