This morning, Tim "TJ" Moreno and Steve Sterns returned to Apple Valley Road to finish the ride they started on June 11th of this year, a ride [cut short by a hit-and-run driver]({% post_url 2011-06-11-hit-and-run-on-apple-valley-road %}).

A large contingent of local riders joined Tim and Steve at the parking lot of the Apple Valley Home Depot at 8:00 a.m. It was inspiring to see everyone there to support Tim and Steve.

[Authorities arrested Michael Bruce Slusser]({% post_url 2011-06-16-hit-and-run-driver-arrested %}), the owner of the truck involved in the hit and run, but so far there is only enough evidence to place the vehicle at the scene of the accident. Slusser has been arraigned and is out on bail. There is a pre-preliminary conference coming up on October 18th, and a preliminary hearing on October 20th (each at 8:30 AM in Department V8). The feeling is that the prosecutor may accept a plea, as opposed to taking the matter to trial.

Although it appears that Slusser was arrested pursuant to a telephone tip, perhaps from his wife (who is reported to have been in the vehicle at the time of the hit-and-run), the information from the tipster seems not to be sufficient for a conviction. This means that the monies we have collected as a reward, most likely will not be paid, and eventually will be returned to those who donated. We'll wait for the final disposition of the case, though, before taking any action.
