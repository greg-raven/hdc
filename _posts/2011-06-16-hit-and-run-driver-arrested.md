The man authorities believe injured two bicyclists over the weekend then fled the scene was arrested late Wednesday night, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Apple Valley station officials said.  
  
Michael Bruce Slusser, 61, of Apple Valley was arrested for felony hit and run at his home, sheriff’s officials said.

Working from various tips from the community, Deputy Jason Grantham was able to track down Slusser at his home, according to Trish Hill, spokeswoman for the Apple Valley station. There he found a vehicle matching the description of the black or green truck with passenger-side damage which struck one cyclist and injured a second.
