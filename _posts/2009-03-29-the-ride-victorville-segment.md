On March 29, 2009, [Phil Keoghan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Keoghan) and his entourage rode through the High Desert as part of his quest to "do something" before he turned forty, while raising money to fight MS. He memorialized this quest in a movie called "[The Ride](https://philkeoghan.com/)," a reference to his 40-day bicycle journey across the United States.

Here's a clip that shows some of the footage of Phil and crew riding through our area.

Local cyclists include Alan Pellegrini, Tim Goforth, Rob Hanna, and [Ron Andring](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/vvdailypress/obituary.aspx?pid=127296352), met Keoghan at The Mall of Victor Valley, and rode down National trails highway. The local cyclists left Keoghan near the drive-in and the freeway, and got rides home. Says Alan Pellegrini, "It's one of my last big memories with Ron."

Keep your eyes peeled for actual video evidence that we do sometimes have to contend with wind events.
