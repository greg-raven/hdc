If you're one of those who enjoys driving for hours to catch a moment's glimpse of a bike rider or two, this weekend's Furnace Creek 508 is for you.

AdventureCORPS is holding its 30th Anniversary Furnace Creek 508 Bicycle Race on October 5-7. Starting in Valencia and finishing in Twentynine Palms, the course has a total elevation gain of over 35,000 feet, crossing ten mountain passes, and stretching from Santa Clarita (just north of Los Angeles), across the Mojave Desert (passing through California City, Randsburg, Trona, Shoshone, Baker, Kelso, and Amboy along the way), through Death Valley National Park and Mojave National Preserve, to the finish line at the gateway to Joshua Tree National Park.

Seriously, though, if you have any interest in ultra-cycling, this is a great opportunity to see it up-close and personal, as Apple Valley is only two to two-and-a-half hours' drive from many points on the course.
