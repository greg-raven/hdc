At a pre-preliminary court conference today, Michael Bruce Slusser withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of "no contest" in the hit-and-run of two local cyclists pursuant to a plea deal reached with prosecutors.

Slusser is accused of hitting local cyclist [Tim "TJ" Moreno]({% post_url 2011-06-11-hit-and-run-on-apple-valley-road %}). Fellow cyclist Steve Stearns was also injured in the collision. It is believed that Slusser was under the influence at the time he hit Moreno, and that his wife --- who was in the truck at the time of the collision --- provided authorities with information.

Sentencing has been scheduled for April 10th at 8:30 in Department V6 (case number FVI1101780).
