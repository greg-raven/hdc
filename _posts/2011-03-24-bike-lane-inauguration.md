About a dozen brave folks gathered tonight’s bike ride to inaugurate the [bike lane on Dale Evans Parkway](https://www.hdcycling.org/2010/12/07/dale-evans-bike-lane-kick-off/). We had a great time despite the late hour, chilly weather, and the even chillier wind. Thank you to everyone who came out and supported Healthy Apple Valley, and cycling in the high desert.

Among those in attendance was James Quigg of the Apple Valley Review, who posted an article online.
