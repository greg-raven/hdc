Attention Cycling Enthusiasts!

The Joshua Tree Rotary is pleased to invite everyone to their 16th annual "Bike 4 Shoes" event, a bike ride for "Shoes That Fit," sponsored by Joshua Tree Rotary.

This is a ride to raise funds to purchase shoes for children in need. Depending on the route you choose, you could be enjoying a challenging but beautiful ride though famous Pioneertown, home of many western movies; the rural town of Landers, home of Giant Rock and the Integratron (watch out for UFOs!); the quaint village of Joshua Tree, a community of artists and musicians and home of the West entrance to the beautiful Joshua Tree National Park; or Yucca Valley, the economic hub of the Morongo Basin.

This year, for those who want to support our event but don't want to or cannot ride a bike, they've added a 5k Walk or Run, and a Walk n' Roll for persons with mobility issues, moms with strollers, or little one with Big Wheels!

Join them for this very special event in our magical desert home, and feel free to bring the whole family! They're looking forward to your help in making a difference in the lives of children in need!!
