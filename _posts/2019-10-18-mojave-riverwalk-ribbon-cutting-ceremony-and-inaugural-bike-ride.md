VICTORVILLE, Calif. (VVNG.com) --- The City of Victorville will host an event to celebrate the Grand Opening of the Victorville Mojave Riverwalk on Nov. 2.

The Fun Run/Walk will begin at 9 a.m., the Ribbon Cutting will take place at 10 a.m., and the Inaugural Bike Ride will immediately follow the Ceremony.

The event will take place at the Mojave Riverwalk Trailhead located at 18564 Bear Valley Road on the Southeast corner of the Victor Valley College Campus. The Victorville City Council approved the Notice of Completion on the Mojave Riverwalk earlier this month.

The Riverwalk is a Class I bike path and pedestrian trail that starts at Fish Hatchery Road at the Victor Valley College Campus, continues under the Yucca Loma Bridge and continues into Mojave Narrows Regional Park --- a distance of 3.9 miles one way. The Riverwalk connects to a longer, seven-mile loop of Class II bike lanes and bike routes that travel throughout central and Old Town Victorville.

"Our Mojave Riverwalk is a wonderful amenity for our community, and we are so proud to celebrate it with our community," said Victorville Mayor Gloria Garcia. "This project is a great example of agencies working together. We are grateful to the Victor Valley College, San Bernardino County, and the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority for their collaboration and support."

The City of Victorville used federal grant monies, local transportation funds and Measure I dollars to fund this $6.9 million project that was 20 years in the making.

Those interested in participating in the Fun Run/Walk and Bike Ride are asked to come early to allow time for registration. Registration for the Fun Run/Walk starts at 8 a.m., and registration for the Bike Ride starts at 9:15 a.m.

The first 100 registrants for the Fun Run/Walk will receive a FREE event t-shirt.

During the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony, the City will recognize donors Elaine Clapp and the Victor Valley Bicycle Tour for their contributions to the project. Sully Miller Contracting constructed the Victorville Mojave Riverwalk and is sponsoring this Grand Opening Celebration.

This event is FREE and open to the public. Parking will be available in a dirt lot near the entrance to the Riverwalk Trailhead.
