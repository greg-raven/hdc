[Trek Women](https://www.trekbikes.com/women/) is holding a Breast Cancer Awareness Ride on Saturday, October 9, at 10:00 a.m. There are going to be 10-mile and 25-mile casual rides, jumping off from [Victorville Cycles](https://victorvillecycles.com/) at 12408 Hesperia Road in Victorville. The $25 entry fee all goes to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and each participant will receive a free gift. The first 100 to sign up even get a free lunch. Registration is on-line here.

Last year we had 84 riders, third best in California, and 11th best in the nation! We are also in need of raffle prize donations, so if you know of anyone that would like to donate contact Carol at Victorville Cycles (760-245-5900). Forward this to all your cycling friends, and we'll see you there!
