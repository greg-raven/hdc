The next stage of the Mojave Riverwalk, a concrete bike trail along the Mojave River near the lower campus of Victor Valley College, is approaching completion. (See "City begins building Mojave Riverwalk.")

According to Sue Jones, the contractor is making finishing touches on the Riverwalk. When these final touches are complete, the Notice of Completion must be approved by the Victorville City Council before they deem this project to be done.

An underpass allows the Mojave Riverwalk to continue northwest alongside the westbound side of Yates Road. The Mojave Riverwalk then forks, with one fork going west to the entrance of the Mojave Narrows Regional Park, with the other fork splitting off to the north through the Park, skirting Pelican Lake on the east side, terminating in a turn-around loop on the north end.

The entrance to the parking area is off of Mojave Fish Hatchery Road, and runs just south of the Victor Valley College Campus Police facility. The parking area has designated parking spots, a water fountain, steps and ramps for reaching the Mojave Riverwalk, shaded picnic-style tables, signage, and new landscaping.

As of now, the city expects the ribbon cutting ceremony sometime in late August or early September.
