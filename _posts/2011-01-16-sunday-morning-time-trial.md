Sorry about the late notice, but there will be a time trial this morning at 8:00 A.M. at [Virginia Park in Apple Valley](https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&ie=UTF8&q=Apple+Valley,+ca,+virginia+park&fb=1&gl=us&hq=Apple+Valley,+ca,+virginia+park&hnear=Apple+Valley,+ca,+virginia+park&cid=0,0,394579127947843462&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A) (on Central, just north of Waalew). It is being put on by members of the Victor Valley Bicycle Club, with an aim toward making this a monthly event. The first riders go off at 8:30. There's no cost, and everyone is welcome.
