The Town of Apple Valley needs community support to build a new bike lane.

The Town is in the process of applying for a grant to add a bike lane on Bear Valley Road. Phase 1 would add a Class 1 bike lane between Apple Valley Road and the Mojave River bridge. Phase 2 would add a structure on the north side of the bridge, just for bikes and pedestrians, extending the bike lane to Victor Valley College.

The Town is currently gathering letters of support and is hoping all cyclists will submit one. The timeline is short: The Town needs to receive your letter no later than this Thursday, March 3, by 12:00 noon. You can email it to Lena Quinonez or drop it off at Town Hall, in her care.
