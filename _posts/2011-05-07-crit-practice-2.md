There will be another [criterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterium) practice on Wednesday, May 11th, at 6:00 pm.

The VVBC is promoting this as a regular Wednesday evening event. Spread the word so we can have a good turnout.

This will be in the (now closed) [Lowe's parking lot on Dale Evans Parkway](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Lowe's+near+Dale+Evans+Parkway,+Apple+Valley,+CA&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=116.143266,108.105469&gl=us&ie=UTF8&hq=Lowe's&hnear=Dale+Evans+Pkwy,+Apple+Valley,+California&ll=34.527958,-117.213108&spn=0.004061,0.003299&t=h&z=18). Tommy will be there early setting up cones. We're going to try to block off access to the course using vehicles, so if you're driving, check in with Tommy to get the best place(s) to park.
