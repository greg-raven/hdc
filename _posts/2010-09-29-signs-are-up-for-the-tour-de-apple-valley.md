Roadside signs have gone up advertising the Tour de Apple Valley, which is less than a month away.

In related news, ride organizers Pat and Chuck Hanson are working with the Town council to work out issues arising out of the road work along Dale Evans, which is on the final leg of the metric half century portion of the ride.
